# Overview

This repository contains the source code and source material for my blog at: https://kelvinhu.github.io/276-website/

# Tech Stack

As it is right now, the frontend is extremely lean, using only HTML5 and CSS. 

I envision a backend in the future using Elixir/Phoenix, Java/Spring (or Java/Quarkus or etc... depending on the proliferation of Project Loom or JEP 444), or C#/ASP.net (perhaps experimenting with Blazor Server).

# License

I choose the MIT license primarily because I don't have an interest in having this project be copyleft and having to maintain that; realistically, who's going to clone a blog that is dedicated to a singular person?

Other than copyleft (which I normally would be in favour of), I wanted this project to be as fire-and-forget as possible.
