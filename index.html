            <h1>Welcome to my (still under construction) blog</h1>

        <!-- Biography -->
        <section>
            <h1>Who are you?</h1>
            <p>
                I think most readers who end up on this site will inevitably ask themselves who I am; to put it simply, I don't really 
                know who I am either. What I can tell you is that I am a studying for a computer science major at Simon Fraser University; 
                I've been studying for longer than I'd like to admit, but I am well on my way to finishing my post-secondary educational goals.

                My education aside, I have an interest in cats, food, and, as the subject of this blog, all things computer science related; though 
                not all posts may have a focus on the science part of computer science.
            </p>

        <!-- Interests -->
        <section>
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>
                I have a fascination with subjects such as distributed systems, operating systems, and programming language development.

                Presently, I'm interested in the following specifics:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://xenproject.org/">Xen Hypervisor</a></li>
                    <li>Plan9 and Inferno</li>
                    <li><a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.3/virtio-v1.3.html">Virtual I/O Devices (or Virtio)</a></li>
                </ul>

                These are all specialized subjects within the realm of computer science, but I hope to one day reach a point where I can
                be proud of what I've created.
            </p>
